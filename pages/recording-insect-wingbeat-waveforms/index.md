## Light sources

The sun is ...

The following sentence popped up as a suggestion by the vscode AI. Left it in for now, but it may not be relevant to the project.

The light source is a 3W LED with a 450nm wavelength. The light source is mounted on a 3D-printed holder that can be adjusted to focus the light beam on the insect.

## Applications for this project

* monitoring of agricultural pests, pollinators and biological control agents
* monitoring flight activity in the vicinity of honeybee hives to include foragers and pests such as hornets and hive beetles
* measuring the efficacy of mosquito coils and other insect repellents
